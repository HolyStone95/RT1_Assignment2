This package is the result of my work on the final assignment of Reaserch Track module 1 course.

\subsection*{General information}

Once runned , this package will provide an interface and nodes to control a robot in a Gazebo simulation, allowing the user to chose between different behaviours for the robot to navigate the environment. In order to be able to work with this package, also the package {\bfseries movebase} and {\bfseries gmapping} are needed.

\subsection*{How to run}

In the {\itshape launch} folder of this package there are 4 launch files, in order to set everything up please run in order \+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch final\_assignment gmapping.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch final ssignment movebase.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch final assignment main.launch
\end{DoxyCode}


At this point the interface should be online
